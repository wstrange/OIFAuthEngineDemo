This is a sample custom authentication engine for Oracle Identity Federation. 

Please see http://blog.warrenstrange.com/2011/12/custom-oif-authentication-engine.html  for more complete documentation.

The AuthSvc/ folder contains a Netbeans project for a sample SOAP authentication service. The service is just for illustrative purposes; Don't be overly concerned with the implemenation.


The engine/ folder contains the OIF engine that calls out to the sample web service. 

The interesting bits are:

- loginpage.jsp:  The page presented to the user.
- forward.jsp:  After the login page OIF forwards control to this page. This
	is where the custom authentication logic happens
- logout.jsp - The logout page kills the OIF session and terminates SSO.

Note: The engine project contains client stubs that call the sample web service. These stubs were generated by wsimport. 

For example:

wsimport -keep -p client http://your-web-svc/authsvc/AuthSvc?WSDL
